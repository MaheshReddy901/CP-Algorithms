# CP-Algorithms
All of my algorithms and implementation of hard cp techniques will be here.

Prime 
  Prime has Prime(sqrt(n)) and sieve algo and prime factorization in (sqrt(n))
  
Exponentiation_and_PrimeF(sieve)
  binary exponentiation, Matrix exponentiation, Prime Factorization using sieve in (nlogn) time complexity
